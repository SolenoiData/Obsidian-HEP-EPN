# A Qualitative Analysis environment 



This environment supports qualitative analysis of text (and potentially other media) with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It is an example of an [Integrated Thinking Environment](https://axle.design/obsidian-roam-and-the-rise-of-integrated-thinking-environments—what-they-are-what-they-do-and-what-s).

## Set up
1. Download this repository as a .zipped folder by selecting the `Code` menu button in the upper-right, and then selecting **Download ZIP**.
2. Extract the downloaded .zip file wherever you'd like in your files.
3. In Obsidian, open the [Vault Picker](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+multiple+vaults) and select **Open Folder as Vault**. Navigate to the newly-extracted folder from step 2, and open it.

## Use
Read the [blog post](https://axle.design/an-integrated-qualitative-analysis-environment-with-obsidian) or review the documentation included in the environment.
