# Introduction to the basics

This repository is intended to run in Obsidian, if you need further information please go to the [[README]] file.
If you need a few tutorials/material to start with some basic languages/programs, here there is a (non-complete and ongoing) list of suggested tutorials:

-   [Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html): Carpentry tutorials for the basics of how to use github/gitlab. This is useful to keep your code in a online repository.
-   [Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/): Carpentry tutorial for `python` and how to create plots using python tools.
-   [Root](https://root.cern/doc/master/group__Tutorials.html): THE software used in collider experiments. There are some examples in `C++` and `python`.
-   [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/): Jupyter notebooks are the way of creating code from your browser. This is the current standard in industry and it is growing quickly in research.
-   [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): the “social network” for data analysts. It is a set of public datasets and jupyter notebooks. Highly recommended.
-   [Kaggle learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn): a set of tutorials in many tools used in data analysis in general. These tutorials are not focused in physics, but for data analyst’s.
-   [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): your jupyter notebooks in your google account.

## Kubernetes

The [[General Idea]] of this will be to run this on a couple nodes.
