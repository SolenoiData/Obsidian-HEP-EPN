## Machine Learning (ML) for High Energy Physics

As a first introduction to what CMS is doing with ML, it is strongly recommended to follow the CMSDAS tutorial. [Link](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1088671/timetable/#90-period-5-short-exercise-mac).

_I suggest you to watch the_ [_lecture_](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1088671/contributions/4577023/attachments/2330165/4045725/GMT20220104-211221_Recording_1920x1120.mp4) _and follow the_ [_slides_](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1088671/contributions/4577023/attachments/2330165/4045705/CMSDAS2021_ML_04Jan2022.pdf)_._

As a first step towards getting used to ML tools, I suggest you to use the CMSDAS material in the [CERN SWAN](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi1z8vfuMn7AhWSm2oFHShpDL4QFnoECA0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fswan.cern.ch%2F&usg=AOvVaw3NDWvDkT5W57BkQ8-V3xGq). SWAN is a hub created at CERN with many tools needed for CERN data analysis. For more information about SWAN follow [this link](https://swan.docs.cern.ch/intro/what_is/). Contact me if you dont have access to SWAN.

In SWAN you will be asked about the environment you need to create, at this moment you can use the default settings and click on Start my Session.
