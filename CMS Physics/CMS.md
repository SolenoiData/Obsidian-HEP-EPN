CMS has a series of schools with introductory topics for newcomers. A list of the latest schools:

-   [CMS Induction Course](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1093833/timetable/#20220620): A set of talks introducing all the main aspects of CMS. From physics, management, detector, etc.
-   [CMSDAS](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1088671/timetable/): CMS Data Analysis School is a set of talks (with videos) focused on the main aspects of data analysis in CMS.Â Highly recommended. Here one can find examples, with working code, of analysis made at CMS.

The CMS Open Data is important because it helps us process data in a way where we can have a series of resulting data from certain collisions. This data can only then be processed with machine learning, meaning that this [[CMS Open Data Workshop 2022]] is the initial step.
